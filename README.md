# cuda-project

In this project we had to deal with A^T * A matrix multiplication. We had to implement three different cases

1. We used cublasDgemm function of cuda 
2. We used a naive implementation of the multiplication
3. We optimized the multiplication using tiling, shared memory, coalesced memory access etc.
